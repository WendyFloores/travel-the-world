  <h2 id="history4">The History</h2>
  
    <p >Mexico has been deeply influenced by Spanish colonisation that began in the 16th century and lasted for almost three centuries. Before European occupation, the land of Mexico was home to expansive Mesoamerican civilisations, such as those of the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Aztec, Maya and Zapotec people.The culture in Mexico is a product of the process of blending of indigenous practices and traditions with the Spanish colonial presence that had such a profound impact on all aspects of life. There has been a constant struggle for Mexican people throughout history to define and promote Mexican identity.And yet that has not stopped them from celebrating on their holidays .Like the day of the dead which we honor our loved ones who have passed away.As well as the five of may in which we celebrate the Anniversary of the Battle of Puebla, holiday celebrated in parts of Mexico and the United States in honor of a military victory in 1862 over the French forces of Napoleon III.

 <h2 id="flag-his">The history behind the flag </h2>
    <p>The Three-Colored Design. The flag of Mexico has three vertical stripes in green, white, and red. The design dates back to 1821, when Mexico finally gained its independence from Spain. When these colors were first adopted, the color green was chosen to represent independence from Spain.The eagle is a symbol of the sun and a representation of the victorious god Huitzilopochtli, in which form, according to legend, bowed to the arriving Aztecs.The red stripe represented the Spaniards that joined in the quest for Mexican Independence. Today, those meanings have shifted somewhat. In the modern age, the green represents hope and victory, the white represents unity, and the red pays tribute to the national heroes who have fought for Mexico over the years.

    <p>A person stands at the foot of Cuexcomate volcano at La Libertad town in the city of Puebla, capital of Puebla state, Mexico, on Aug. 18, 2015. According to local press, the Cuexcomate volcano, whose name comes from the Nahuatl word "cuexcomatl" which means "clay pot" or "place to keep", is known as the world's smallest volcano, but it is not a volcano, but a formation caused hundreds of years ago by a flow of hydrogen sulphide water a result of an eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano. After some remodeling work in the area with an investment of 6 million pesos, now the vistors can access into the Cuexcomate through stairs going up to the top and continue to fall inward, which are a set of stalactites and a natural spring with fish, which comes from underground rivers and forming a waterfall whose level is increased or decreased depending on the volcanic status of Popocatepetl. It offers guided tours where the tourists can hear different legends about its origin and history ranging from pre-Hispanic times and postcolonial that making it a natural attraction with mystical features.

    <p>Located in the city's historic center is the Zócalo de Puebla, a main square and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Formerly a marketplace and bullfighting stage, this large and attractive plaza is now a common gathering ground for cultural and political events. Plan a visit here to see the Catedral de Puebla (Puebla Cathedral), statues and monuments, and San Miguel Arcángel Fountain, which dates back to 1777. The Zócalo can get quite crowded on weekends, but it makes for great people-watching. This is the perfect starting point for a walking tour of Puebla.</p>
