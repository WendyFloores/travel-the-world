 <h2 id="history2">The History &#127802;</h2>
  
    <p >Maui's culture today is rooted in Hawaiian traditions – the Aloha Spirit, the Hawaiian language, hula, surfing, and the beauty and spirit of the land. Western explorers arrived in Hawai`i using modern tools of navigation and sailing. They arrived to Hawai`i as sandalwood traders, whalers, and in 1820 as missionaries.The name Māui is a demi-god who is popular in the Native Hawaiian culture. He is known for being the “trickster.” It is said that he owns a great fish-hook called Manaiakalani. Legend has it that Māui created the Hawaiian islands by tricking his brothers into going fishing with him.

 <h2 id="flag-h">The history behind the flag &#127802; </h2>
    <p>The flag of the County of Maui has a light blue field bearing a circular, central insignia bounded by an inverted maile wreath with green leaves and white highlights. The diameter of the wreath is roughly half the length of the flag.The Hawaii flag's eight stripes represent the major Islands. Historians credit its design to an officer of the Royal Navy, who based it on a British naval flag. While the ensign has become the official state flag of Hawaii, there are some that argue it is not the original flag of the Hawaiian kingdom</p>

<h2 id="Food-2eat">Food that Maui has to offer &#127802; :</h2>

    
    <ul>
      
      <li>Shaved ice</li>
      
      <img class="photo" src="https://ouradventurejournal.com/ezoimgfmt/i0.wp.com/ouradventurejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/P1090172-copy.jpg?fit=800%2C601&ssl=1&ezimgfmt=rs:352x264/rscb1/ngcb1/notWebP" width="565">
      
      <p>There’s shaved ice and then there’s Hawaiian-style ones where it’s so finely shaved that what you eat is what you imagine clouds would taste like. Dress your shaved ice in flavored syrup like lilikoi (passionfruit), li hing mui (salty dried plum), and guava, before topping it off with condensed milk, mochi balls, ice cream, and azuki beans. It’s also a good way to combat the warm Hawaiian weather.</p>


      
      <li>Açai Bowls</li>

      <img class="photo" src="https://simple-veganista.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/homemade-acai-bowl-7.jpg" width="565">

      <p>While this isn’t technically classic Hawaiian food, this bowl of fruity goodness is served on every menu that it almost should be. It’s a blend of fresh açai berries topped with granola, fruits like banana, berries, and pineapple, before it’s drizzled over with local honey. It’s also a great excuse to have an ice-cream like dish for breakfast, without the guilt. </p>


      
      <li>Malasadas</li>

    <img class="photo" src="https://www.favfamilyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/filled-malasadas-vertical.jpg" width="565">
      
      <p>If you’re looking for something healthy, turn the other way now. Malasadas are everything but good for you, but they’re worth every calorie. Coated in sugar, the deep-fried balls of doughy bread are best enjoyed fresh out of the deep-fryer for breakfast, as a snack, or dessert.</p>


      
    <li>Saimin </li>

      <img class="photo" src="https://www.196flavors.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/saimin-1-FP.jpg" width="565">

   <p>Saimin is a hearty egg-noodle soup dish that represents a mix of the island’s Chinese Japanese and Filipino heritage. Think a bowl of ramen with a broth made from a light dashi stock, egg noodles slightly softer in texture than what’s typically used for ramen, and garnishes like green shallots, char siu pork, spam, egg and Asian greens.</p>
