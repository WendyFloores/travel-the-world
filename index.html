 <h2 id="history-flag">The history behind the flag </h2>
    
    <p>The "tricolore" (three-colour) flag is an emblem of the Fifth Republic. It had its origins in the union, at the time of the French Revolution, of the colours of the King (white) and the City of Paris (blue and red). Today, the "tricolour" flies over all public buildings.Why does France have 2 flags?
Since 1976, there have been two versions of the flag in varying levels of use by the state: the original (identifiable by its use of navy blue) and one with a lighter shade of blue. Since 2021, France has used the older variant by default, including at the Élysée Palac.</p>
