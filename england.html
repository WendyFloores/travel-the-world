  <h2 id="history">The History</h2>
 
    <p >Historically, London grew from three distinct centres: the walled settlement founded by the Romans on the banks of the Thames in the 1st century ce, today known as the City of London, “the Square Mile,” or simply “the City”; facing it across the bridge on the lower gravels of the south bank, the suburb of Southwark.London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom and one of the largest and most important cities in the world. The area was originally settled by early hunter gatherers around 6,000 B.C., and researchers have found evidence of Bronze Age bridges and Iron Age forts near the River Thames.

 <h2 id="flag-h">The History Behind the Flag </h2>
   
    <p>The flag of the City of London is based on the English flag, having a centred St George's Cross on a white background, with a red sword in the upper hoist canton (the top left quarter). The sword is believed to represent the sword that beheaded Saint Paul who is the patron saint of the city.The first use of the flag of England as a maritime flag was in 1545, during the reign of Henry VIII. When England and Scotland united with the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the red cross was combined with the blue and white St Andrew's Cross of Scotland to create the first version of the Union Jack.</p>
