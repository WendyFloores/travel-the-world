  <h2 id="history3">The History</h2>
  
    <p >The history of New York begins around 10,000 B.C. when the first people arrived. By 1100 A.D. two main cultures had become dominant as the Iroquoian and Algonquian developed. European discovery of New York was led by the Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 followed by the first land claim in 1609 by the Dutch.The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790, and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790.
</p>



    
 <h2 id="flag-hi">The history behind the flag </h2>
    <p>The flags of New York City include the flag of New York City, the respective flags of the boroughs of The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island, and flags of certain city departments.The official state flag of New York was adopted in 1901. Emblazoned on a dark blue field is the state coat of arms, which was officially adopted by New York in 1778. The flag's design features the goddess Liberty holding a pole with a Liberty Cap on top. Liberty stands for freedom.The official state flag of New York was adopted in 1901</p>

    <li>Central Park </li>
   
    <img class="photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FdyQrNNWIAEIlav.jpg" width="565">
   
    <p>Central Park is an urban park between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City, United States. It is the fifth-largest park in the city, containing 843 acres, and the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 42 million visitors annually as of 2016.Your complete guide to New York City's Central Park, including attractions, activities, events, concerts, tours, hotel information and the Central Park Zoo.

      
    
    <li>Little Island </li>

    <p>Little Island at Pier 55 is an artificial island park in the Hudson River west of Manhattan in New York City, adjoining Hudson River Park.

    <li> Head inside the Vessel  </li>
   
    <img class="photo" src="https://handluggageonly.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0137-2.jpg" width="565">
   
    <p>Okay, so the Vessel is perched in Hudson’s Yard and one of the largest, interactive and striking art installations in New York. Just shy of Hell’s Kitchen, it’s a totally beautiful and abstract piece that you can scale yourself.It's even more beautiful around sunset time.</p>
   

    
    <li> The Brooklyn Bridge</li>
    
    <img class="photo" src="https://triptins.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Brooklyn-Bridge-Walk.jpeg.webp" width="565">
   
    <p>Walking across the Brooklyn Bridge is almost a staple whilst visiting and easily one of the best attractions in New York to see.
Also, let’s be honest, it’s probably one of the most famous bridges on the east coast of America, too. The Brooklyn Bridge is a totally iconic part of New York and you can’t miss it. Now, the walk itself can take as long or as short as your nimble legs will take you. Though be aware, it does get busier at certain times of the day so if you want to miss most of the crowds go very early in the morning.After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, make sure to stop off at Dumbo, Brooklyn for an iconic photo and head to Westville for the tastiest brunch this side of New York. </p>

    
    
    <li>Statue Of Liberty</li>
    
    <img class="photo" src ="https://cdn-imgix.headout.com/blog-content/image/a3d515edc02dbf92592b5258e20e66fb-tania-fernandez-vdjLv8Gwo0g-unsplash%20(1).jpg?auto=compress&fm=webp&w=1200&h=650&crop=faces&fit=min" width="565">
   
    <p>Obviously, the Statue Of Liberty is not just the symbol of New York but of the USA, more generally. This means it’s one spot you can’t really miss if you’ve never visited the city before. Take a cruise boat (near Battery Park) and spend about 3-4 hours exploring Liberty Island, seeing the Statue Of Liberty and hopping over to Ellis Island, too. It really is one of the best attractions in New York that you really have to see. Now, the whole trip will take around 4-hours and expect some queuing at security to board the boats.</p>

<h2 id="Food-at">Food that NYC has to offer &#127802; :</h2>

    
    <ul>
      
      <li>Black Tap: Milkshakes</li>
      
      <img class="photo" src="https://www.reead.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/milkshake-black-tap.jpg" width="565">
      
      <p>If you’re looking for one of the craziest milkshakes you will ever try in your life, Blacktap is 100% our go-to. The Female Foodie team agrees that while the actual ice cream in these milkshakes is nothing to write home about, the composition and creativity of each of these shakes certainly are making them a very iconic NYC dessert. Our favorite shakes are the , or make sure to watch for their rotating specials. Because who wouldn’t want a slice of chocolate cake or donuts or a slice of birthday cake on top of their 16 ounce milkshake?</p>


      
      <li> Momofuku Milk Bar: Cereal Milk Soft Serve</li>

      <img class="photo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gr98ha4kHvtuXxNZkuzxjq5juag=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9642503/milkbarsoftserve.jpg" width="565">

      <p> heard a lot of mixed reviews on Milk Bar before trying it- most seemed to love or hate their ice cream and I have to say that I LIKED it! The cereal milk soft serve (yes, it tastes like the milk at the bottom of a bowl of cereal) comes out of left field but I loved how unique and surprisingly nostalgic it was. Plus the texture of caramelized cornflakes scattered throughout was pretty hard to beat. Other popular items here include the crack pie, compost cookie, and birthday cake.</p>


      
      <li>Wafels & Dinges: Liege Wafel</li>

    <img class="photo" src="https://tb-static.uber.com/prod/image-proc/processed_images/7c89c6e31d0f4e7d25a279e6755ea7e8/3ac2b39ad528f8c8c5dc77c59abb683d.jpeg" width="565">
      
      <p>One of the best desserts in NYC originally started as a food truck in 2007 and now serves their amazing waffles in nearly one dozen locations across town. The Liege Wafel is truly to die for- made with pearl sugar that caramelizes when the dough hits the waffle iron and topped with a variety of delicious additions depending on what you fancy. We recommend trying the classic Liège waffle with strawberries, whipped cream, and a touch of nutella if you’re feeling extra decadent.</p>


      
    <li>Two Little Red Hens: Cupcakes </li>

      <img class="photo" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c282addc3c16a3f1c3d8855/5c28303c1ae6cf9b88409260/5c2849edaa4a995f08a519ff/1593205652910/two-little-red-hens_13130263644_o.jpg?format=1500w" width="565">

   <p>When it comes to cupcakes in New York City, we searched far and wide for GREAT cupcakes that we felt were worth our time and money. Not going to mention names,  but several of the popular NYC cupcake spots were underwhelming to us and provided finished products that were either dry or lacking in flavor. If you’re looking for a cupcake done right in the Big Apple, make sure you grab them at the Two Little Red Hens bakery. They do an absolutely fantastic job at making moist, flavorful cupcakes in both their regular and mini sizes.</p>
